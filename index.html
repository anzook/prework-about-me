      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an environemtnal engineer, who's looking forward to learning
         how to create in a new medium!
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Lancaster County, PA, I then went to study at Lehigh University.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I have too many hobbies and not enough time. Many mornings, I can be found
         rowing with the Baltimore Rowing Club and evenings I can be found under my car.
          I have a thing for old BMWs and enjoy keeping them running. My creative outlet 
          recently has been making vinyl stickers for friends. I also love many outdoor 
          activities, but especially hanging out by the river. 
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>In my dream job, I'd find myself in a position to not only be creative and work
         with others, but constantly be challenged and maintain enjoyment in the work. I want
          to find balance between my work and life demands and wants. Possibly someday I will
           start my own business...
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I now live in Baltimore City, MD with my Fiance and puppy, Moose.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been into computers. In middle school, I discovered the joy of 
        building your own computer and learned all about hardware, however I never branched
         out to software development. I went to school to study engineering, but it was all 
         traditional physical disciplines. I understood that well, but the more I expereinced 
         working, the more I saw a need to interface with a digital world. My college roomate 
         went on to do a boot camp himself, and loved it so much he stayed to teach for a bit. 
         Finally, when I hit a turning point in my career, I realized it was time for me to learn
          to code as well. I'm excited for the challenges and opportunities this will provide me!
